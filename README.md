# Branch-predictor-
In this project implemented one bit and two bit branch predictor and compared their efficiency
Use python to built a branch predictor simulator. Inorder to implement this took a trace of a program as a input to predict the braches in the program. Developed an algorith to predict the branches in the program. Moreover Implemented one bit and two bit branch predictors and also compared their efficencies
